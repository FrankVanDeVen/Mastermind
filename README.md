"Mastemind" is a Mastermind game clone for the Arduboy. 

From Wikipedia: Mastermind or Master Mind is a code-breaking game for two players. The modern game with pegs was invented in 1970 by Mordecai Meirowitz, an Israeli postmaster and telecommunications expert.

To play the game you need to hold your Arduboy horizontally. 

Buttons: 
A:          Game information or check the entered code. 
B:          Start a new game. 
Up/Down:    Change the number (1 to 6).
Left/right: Change the column where you want to change the number. 

When you start a new game, Mastermand chooses a 4-digit code from the numbers 1 to 6. 
The code does not contain double digits. 

If you press the A button, Mastermint compares your code with the chosen code. A black circle means that a number in the guessed code is present and is in its correct place. A white circle means that a number in the guessed code is present but isn't in its correct place.

Good luck.
